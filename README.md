musl-clang for Fedora 29
==========

This is a fork of esjeon/musl-clang tested and modify for Fedora 29 - Last update 11/12/2018.

A clang wrapper for musl C library. Pretty hacky, I know. This one supports static linking with `-static` flag. 

Adjust `PREFIX` or define `MUSL_PREFIX` before running the script.

Tested under Debian linux with dash shell. Should work okay with bash.
